## HESS (Heritability Estimation from Summary Statistics)

#### Overview

HESS estimates the amount of variance in trait explained by typed SNPs at
each single loci on the genome (local SNP-heritability) from GWAS summary
statics, while accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD).

#### File format

HESS requires GWAS summary statistics and reference panel matching the GWAS
population as input.
